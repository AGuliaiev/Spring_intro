## Project Overview

The **Bookshop API** is an online bookstore backend that supports functionalities such as user registration, book browsing, shopping cart management, and order placement. It aims to be robust, secure, and simple to integrate with front-end interfaces, providing a comprehensive backend for managing books, orders, and user accounts.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** - Core programming language for backend development.
- **Spring Boot** - Framework used for building the API with quick setup and pre-configured defaults.
- **Spring Security** - Provides authentication and authorization features to secure the application.
- **Spring Data JPA** - Simplifies database access and supports relational data management.
- **Swagger** - Used for API documentation, making it easier to understand and test the endpoints.
- **Docker** - Containerization for simplified setup and deployment.
- **Test containers** - Integration testing with real databases in Docker.
- **Liquibase** - Manages database migrations and versioning.
- **JUnit & Mockito** - Unit testing and mocking for test coverage.
- **Maven** - Dependency management and build tool to streamline project setup and maintenance.
- **TC Database**: Lightweight, in-memory database for testing purposes
- **Postman**: For endpoint testing and verification

## Features
This API includes the following main features:

1. **User Registration and Authentication** - Users can register, log in, and log out securely, with token-based authentication provided by Spring Security.
2. **Book Management** - Admin users can add, edit, or delete books, while regular users can browse the book catalog.
3. **Category Management** - Allows categorization of books, enabling better browsing and filtering for users.
4. **Shopping Cart** - Users can add, view, update, and remove items in their shopping cart.
5. **Order Processing** - Handles order creation, confirmation, and payment (with placeholder endpoints for payment integration).
6. **API Documentation** - Provides an interactive interface through Swagger for testing and understanding API endpoints.

## Architecture
The architecture of the project follows a typical layered structure for a Spring Boot application:

1. **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and sends responses.
2. **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and manages transactions.
3. **Repository Layer**: Directly interacts with the database using JPA.
4. **Entity Layer**: Models core entities like User, Book, Order, and Category.
5. **Security Layer**: Manages authentication and authorization using JWT.
6. **Documentation Layer**: Swagger setup for API interaction.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- **Java 17** or higher
- **Maven** for dependency management
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**

### Steps to Launch the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AGuliaiev/Spring_intro
   ```
2. **Configure Environment Variables:** Create a .env file with the following variables:
    ```env
    MYSQL_DB=book_shop
    MYSQL_USER=your_mysql_user
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root_password
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=superpassword
    MYSQLDB_USER=mysql_user
    MYSQLDB_PASSWORD=mysql_password
    MYSQL_LOCAL_PORT=3307
    MYSQL_DOCKER_PORT=3306
   
    SPRING_LOCAL_PORT=8088
    SPRING_DOCKER_PORT=8080
    DEBUG_PORT=5005
   ```
3. **Run Docker Containers:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
4. **Access the API:**
   - **Swagger Documentation:** Open [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8088/swagger-ui/) to explore and test API endpoints.
   - **Application:** Accessible at http://localhost:8080.

5. **Run Tests** Execute unit and integration tests:
    ```bash
   mvn clean test
   ```

## API Documentation
The API documentation is available via Swagger and includes the following key endpoints:
1. **User Registration** - POST /auth/register: Allows new users to create accounts.
2. **User Login** - POST /auth/login: Authenticates users and returns a JWT token.
3. **Book Management** - GET /books, POST /books (admin), PUT /books/{id} (admin), DELETE /books/{id} (admin).
4. **Category Management** - GET /categories, POST /categories (admin).
5. **Shopping Cart** - POST /cart: Adds a book to the user's cart, GET /cart: Views current cart items.
6. **Order Processing** - POST /orders: Places a new order based on the items in the cart.
Visit [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8088/swagger-ui/) to view all endpoints and their detailed descriptions.

## Challenges & Solutions
1. **Database Migration:**
    - **Issue:** Ensuring schema consistency across environments.
    - **Solution:** Used Liquibase for versioned migrations, ensuring consistency and easy rollback in case of issues.
2. **Security Authentication:**
    - **Issue:** Securing endpoints based on user roles and managing JWT tokens.
    - **Solution:** Configured Spring Security with role-based access controls and implemented JWT-based authentication for stateless session management.
3. **Testing with Docker:**
    - **Issue:** Managing test environments with real databases.
    - **Solution:** Utilized Test-containers for Docker-based integration testing.

## Future Improvements
1. **Enhanced Search and Filtering** - Adding more filters for book categories, authors, and prices to improve user experience.
2. **Full Payment Integration** - Integrating with a payment gateway for real transaction processing.
3. **Order History and Notifications** - Adding order history for users and email/SMS notifications upon order placement.
4. **Review and Rating System** - Allowing users to rate and review books for better recommendations.

## Usage Demo
For a quick demonstration of how this project works, you can use the following methods:
 - **Swagger UI** - Visit [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8088/swagger-ui/) to interact with the API.
 - **Testing the API with Postman** 
   To test the Bookshop API endpoints using Postman, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Your Environment in Postman:**
   - Open Postman and create a new environment.
   - Add a variable base_url with a value pointing to your local server (e.g., http://localhost:8080).

2. **Create Requests:**
   - Manually create HTTP requests for each API endpoint you want to test, setting the URL to {{base_url}}/your-endpoint.
   - For example:
      - **User Registration:** POST {{base_url}}/auth/register
      - **Login:** POST {{base_url}}/auth/login 
      - **View Books:** GET {{base_url}}/books

3. **Add Authorization:**
   - For endpoints requiring authorization, obtain a JWT token from the login endpoint.
   - Add this token to the Authorization tab of your request as a Bearer Token.

4. **Send Requests:**
   - Once configured, click Send to test each endpoint.
   - Check the response to verify correct functionality and troubleshoot as needed.

With Postman, you can quickly test each API endpoint and verify the application's functionality.
